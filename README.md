# Mini Seller Console

This project is my solution to the frontend challenge from **CoverPin Company**. The goal was to build a lightweight console to manage and convert Leads into Opportunities, demonstrating skills in modern UI development, code structure, and user experience.

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- [x] **Leads List:** Data is loaded from a local JSON file.
- [x] **Dynamic Search:** Filter by name or company in real-time.
- [x] **Status Filter:** Allows viewing leads based on their current status.
- [x] **Score Sorting:** Sort the list by `score` in both ascending and descending order.
- [x] **Details Panel:** A slide-over panel opens on lead click, showing all details.
- [x] **Inline Editing:** Inside the panel, it's possible to edit the lead's email and status.
- [x] **Email Validation:** The email field includes format validation to ensure data integrity.
- [x] **Save/Cancel Actions:** With visual feedback and basic error handling.
- [x] **Convert to Opportunity:** A lead can be converted into an opportunity, moving it to a new list.
- [x] **Opportunities Table:** Displays all created opportunities in a simple table.
- [x] **UI States:** The application shows a "Loading" state while preparing the data.

### Nice-to-Haves
- [x] **Responsive Layout (Desktop ‚Üí Mobile):** The interface was carefully designed to be fully functional and user-friendly on both large screens and mobile devices. Tables transform into "card" lists for better readability on smaller screens.
- [x] **Tab-Based Organization:** To improve user experience, especially on mobile, the Leads and Opportunities views were separated into tabs, preventing an overly long page scroll.
